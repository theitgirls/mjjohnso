        <h2>My Post about Elizabeth Freidman</h2>

            Elizabeth Friedman was a cryptanalyst who deciphered codes in both World War 1 and 2. She was born on August 26th, 1892. She attended Wooster college in Ohio and graduated from Hillsdale college in Michigan. She then went on to become a cryptologist and code breaker. Friedman was hired by the U.S coast guard, and started the first code breaking unit and  through this she was able to crack around 12,000 encryptions. In the 1940s she eavesdropped on German spies and she along with a team of others were able to break enigma codes. Her determination throughout her career was groundbreaking, and paved the way for multitudes of women in STEM in the future.

            <h2>Teachabe Machines</h2>
            <p>Maya Johnson / July 19th, 2022</p>

                During the teachable machines lesson I worked with Kate and Gia. We used facial recognition technology to make a program for teachers that would detect if their students are paying attention during class. We created three different scenarios, writing notes, zoning out, and on a phone. We had to take close to 800 photos of each of us per scenario. Taking this many photos allowed us to get the most accurate results, as each photo gave the computer a different perspective. This lesson gave us a great insight into AI and how it will be used in various ways in the future as every group created a unique program. I believe that in the future Ai will be used in educational settings. For example, in the future robots could be teachers,  this could be helpful with the current shortage of teachers and if perfected it would be a life changing tool.
