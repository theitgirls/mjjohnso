            Elizabeth Friedman was a cryptanalyst who deciphered codes in both World War 1 and 2. She was born on August 26th, 1892. She attended Wooster college in Ohio and graduated from Hillsdale college in Michigan. She then went on to become a cryptologist and code breaker. Friedman was hired by the U.S coast guard, and started the first code breaking unit and  through this she was able to crack around 12,000 encryptions. In the 1940s she eavesdropped on German spies and she along with a team of others were able to break enigma codes. Her determination throughout her career was groundbreaking, and paved the way for multitudes of women in STEM in the future.
